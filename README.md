# Chip255
![Chip255](image.png)

Chip255 is CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator written in the Processing programming language. This interpreter features a debug overlay to view the current state of the machine. This includes registers, the stack, and other variables such as the program counter and timers. For more information on CHIP-8, here's the [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)

The CHIP-8 uses a hexidecimal keypad for input. Chip255 maps each key like so:
```
1 2 3 C  ->  1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D  ->  q w e r
7 8 9 E  ->  a s d f
A 0 B F  ->  z x c v
```
